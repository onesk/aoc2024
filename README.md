I've already done Rust, TypeScript and Go, and back in 2017 in Python I even somehow ended on a leaderboard.

But this year I had trouble picking the language. Could've done this in Haskell or Zig or Elixir or whatever is the fashion these days, but in the end thought that this might be just the reason I've always needed to learn Emacs Lisp. I'm not particularly excited by forty year old tech, on one hand, but on the other hand I spend better part of my life in Emacs, so why not.

Unfortunately, the time gap between parts one and two of day 1 will be forever marked on my personal timeline.
